## Modelling the Voltage Response of Lithium Ion Batteries
### (See the above PDF)

In this thesis, two battery models are developed and investigated for their ability to accurately simulate the terminal voltage of a lithium-ion cell with the high-level goal of improving energy management algorithms in electric vehicles. A nonlinear battery model which accounts for key electrochemical processes in the lithium-ion battery is developed and tested on experimental pulse discharge data. The interpretability and generalizability of this model are investigated, showing that the nonlinear model has the ability to provide useful insights into the charge transfer reaction. A linearized version of the nonlinear model is developed and validated using voltage responses simulated by the nonlinear model, revealing its potential to be a simpler, but still effective alternative to the nonlinear model for predicting voltage responses around specific operating points. While energy management algorithms will not likely be improved directly using the results presented in this thesis, the work established here adds to the existing literature by thoroughly documenting the battery model development and testing process such that others new to the field can learn and build upon the successes and failures of this work.
